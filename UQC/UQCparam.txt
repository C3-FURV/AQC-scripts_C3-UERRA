Part I

Please write always from the beginning of the line following the question.

1) Name of the red (5 characters):


2) Number of sites (1-100):


3) TT is available? (Y/N) 


4) RH is available? (Y/N)


5) TD is included in RH files? (Y/N)


6) VV is available? (Y/N)


7) DD is included in VV files? (Y/N)


8) Tn&Tx is available? (Y/N)


9) First year and last year with data (in the entire dataset) 



Part II

Only the order of parameters is fixed, the format of numbers and the number of space characters between them are indifferent.
Exceptions: For question 5) only whole numbers are accepted.

1) Absolute minimums and maximums for TT, RH, VV and DD:
(°C for TT, % for RH, m/s for VV and ° for DD)
-92  58  1  100  0  98  0  360

2) Max. extreme anomaly relative to the monthly PDF=0.05 or PDF=0.95,
for TT, TD (PDF=0.05) and TD (PDF=0.95) (°C)
8.0  10.0  6.0

3) Max. extreme anomaly relative to the annual PDF=0.05 or PDF=0.95,
for TT, TD (PDF=0.05), TD (PDF=0.95) (°C) and VV (PDF=0.95, coefficient)
12.0  14.0  10.0  4.0

4) Threshold anomalies (min. and max.) in the mean changes between
two adjacent values for TT, RH VV and DD (coefficient)

7) Sharp spikes: max. changes below and after the point, within 16 hours
for TT (annual and diurnal changes filtered) in °C
12.0  6.0

8) Joint change in sudden warming
TT (°C), RH (ratio relative to the initial value)
10.0  0.92

9) Joint change in sudden cooling
TT (°C), RH (ratio of the change of (100% - RH) relative to its initial value), VV (m/S)
-8.0  0.80  3.0

10) Absolute difference of TD in source data and TD calculated by the program
TD (°C)
